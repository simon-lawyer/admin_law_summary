# Introduction
This is a manual that will help litigators better understand the nature of Canadian administrative law.

## I. First principles
Let us begin by reviewing some first principles...

## II. The lay of the land
It is also important to understand the empirical lay of the land. This manual was built after analyzing decisions from the Federal Court of Canada where an administrative law error was found. It is helpful to generally understand the types of disputes and areas of law that generate administrative law problems. I broadly summarize those here.

### 1. Refugee Protection Division

### 2. Humanitarian and Compassionate Applications

# A. Reasonableness Errors
A reasonableness error is a mistake in an administrative decision where the conclusion reached lacks justification, transparency, or intelligibility. It does not align with the facts or legal standards applicable to the case.

## I. Transparency
### 1. Illusory inconsistency 
An error occurs when a decision relies on false or illusory inconsistencies to ground a negative credibility finding. 

*Case summaries*

**Portillo de Jurado v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2024 FC 1108**  
The Court found that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) erred in its credibility findings regarding the Applicants' fear of persecution by the MS-13 gang. The RPD's conclusion that the Applicants had not disclosed their trip to the U.S. was based on a misinterpretation of facts, leading to an illusory contradiction. The mistake in considering the trip's omission constituted a lack of transparency in the decision-making process.

## II. Intelligibility
### 1. Flawed credibility assessments
An error occurs when a decision-maker's credibility findings are based on irrelevant legal standards or personal assumptions, thereby losing the logical chain of reasoning required for a sound decision.

*Case summaries*

**Portillo de Jurado v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2024 FC 1108**  
The Court identified that the RPD's reliance on the absence of "subjective fear"—a concept pertinent only to claims under s. 96 of the IRPA—undermined the decision's intelligibility. As no Convention ground existed in the Applicants’ case, the RPD's application of this standard was improper. Such errors contributed to unfounded credibility inferences.

## III. Justification
### 1. Misapplication of cumulative risk principle
The principle of cumulative risk in credibility assessments should be properly applied to evaluate the overall context rather than isolate pieces of evidence separately without justification.

*Case summaries*

**Portillo de Jurado v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2024 FC 1108**  
Despite documented evidence, the RPD failed to appreciate the cumulative nature of MS-13-related threats that fluctuated over time. The rejection of evidence based on assumptions of particular "fixed date" triggers showed a misapplication of cumulative assessment principles, leading to an unjustified decision.
